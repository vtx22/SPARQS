# SPARQ Format Documentation
## Modes
### Byte Mode
With byte mode selected all values are transmitted in non human readable form as bytes. This format is preferred as it is the most efficient because it uses a minimal amount of data per message.
### ACSCII Mode
In ASCII Mode all values are transmitted as chars for each decimal digit which is especially useful for console debugging purposes.
